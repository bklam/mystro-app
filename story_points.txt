1. As a teacher, I want to login to my dashboard so that I can view my schedule and other information

- be able to login and authenticate (using a gem, probably devise)
- generate scaffolding and new app
- using plugin, show schedule on dashboard page
- options for calendar display (day week month) on dashboard
- be able to set default setting for calendar display
- sidebar with access to other pages (my students, expenses, etc.)
- news feed with important notifications from past 24 hours and upcoming 24 hours
-
